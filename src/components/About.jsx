                    My name is Sairam Kaushik, and I'm a third-year student pursuing bachelor's of technology in computer science with a specialization in digital forensics and cybersecurity. I currently work for a college-based startup that is focuses in building an elderly matrimonial site. I'm a passionate frontend developer[ using the MERN stack], also a graphic designer having experience with tools like figma, photoshop, Adobe premiere pro etc. Furthermore, I'm interested in cyber security. I enjoy learning about new cyber attacks, playing CTF, and trying out different security tools. In addition to technical work, I also remain busy with a variety of extracurricular activities. I am the team leader for the graphics and design team at the international hackathon "HACK THE MOUNTAINS 3.0." . At Google Developer Student Clubs MRIIRS, I am also assigned the role of design head. My confidence and leadership abilities have grown as a result of being a part of such a community with like-minded people.Lastly, I regularly go to technical meetups and broaden my network with professionals at the industry's top levels. This helps me maintain my dedication of improving myself every day.
