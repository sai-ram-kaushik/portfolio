                My name is Sairam Kaushik, and I'm a third-year student pursuing
                bachelor's of technology in computer science with a
                specialization in digital forensics and cybersecurity. I
                currently work for a college-based startup that is focuses in
                building an elderly matrimonial site. I'm a passionate frontend
                developer [using the MERN stack], also a graphic designer having
                experience with tools like figma, photoshop, Adobe premiere pro
                etc. Furthermore, I'm interested in cyber security. I enjoy
                learning about new cyber attacks, playing CTF, and trying out
                different security tools. In addition to technical work, I also
                remain busy with a variety of extracurricular activities. I am
                the team leader for the graphics and design team at the
                international hackathon "HACK THE MOUNTAINS 3.0." . At Google
                Developer Student Clubs MRIIRS, I am also assigned the role of
                design head. My confidence and leadership abilities have grown
                as a result of being a part of such a community with like-minded
                people.Lastly, I regularly go to technical meetups and broaden
                my network with professionals at the industry's top levels. This
                helps me maintain my dedication of improving myself every day.
